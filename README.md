# FancyClock

When I was shopping once in downtown Toronto one day I saw what I thought was the coolest clock I had ever seen. It used words lighting up instead of numbers or hands to tell you the time, and I thought it was so unique, I had to have it. Then when I checked the price tag, I saw it was over $1000. A little too much for a clock in my opinion. I figured I could probably make this clock with my Raspberry Pi and some fancy LEDs. I modeled it with a webpage, and I'm in the process of finding the right materials to replicate it myself.
